# [Wordhop](https://www.wordhop.io) - A toolkit for creating a hybrid Chatbot + human conversational UX

With Wordhop you can connect Chatbots you're building on different messaging platforms to a Slack team and toggle between automated and human-powered messaging.  Simply add Wordhop to Slack and then drop in a couple of lines of code into your Chatbot.  Wordhop integrates in minutes, not days, and begins working immediately.  Wordhop monitors your Chatbot and alerts a Slack channel when a human might want to take over the conversation. From Slack, you can pause your Chatbot and start chatting live with your users and when you're ready, hand the conversation back to your Chatbot. Wordhop gives you the flexibility to scale with Chatbots while being able to delight your customers with Humans. Actionable analytics show you how your customers interact with your Chatbot so you can optimize your conversational experience and then measure the results.
